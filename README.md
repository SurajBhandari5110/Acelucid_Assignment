Programming language used python.
Q1-Print triangle takiing row input from user.
I program is solved using nested loop, crated i variable for row and j for columns.
fisrt loop will check number of rows(i=1,i<=n,i++) and second loop will check for number of columns(j=1,j<=i,j++).
Q2-Find valid Date
I used regular expression to solve this program as it will be best for finding pattern in a string.
Regular expression, for finding date is date_pattern = re.compile(r'(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{4})')..
If pattern matches print date_pattern or if not then print no valid date.
